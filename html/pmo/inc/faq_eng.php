                    <h3>We have already paid the car rental company.</h3>
                    Car rental companies are not able to collect payment of fines on behalf of the   police force. On the basis of what is stipulated in the car rental agreement you   signed with the company, the amount paid with your credit card corresponds to   the administrative expenses incurred by the car rental company for having   transmitted your personal data to the authorities, after which the police took   care of sending you the fine for the violation of the traffic code perpetrated   by the vehicle in question during the rental period.

                    <h3>What is the ZTL (limited traffic zone)?</h3>
                    The limited traffic zone is an area where the circulating of unauthorised   vehicles is not allowed. Only the following vehicles may access this area:   vehicles at the service of the disable and vehicles with special permits issued   by the city council. Normally the accesses in the larger cities are controlled   by cameras which take photos of the unauthorised vehicles as they enter. All   entrances to the ZTL recorded by the camera are considered as distinct and   separate violations due to being dynamic violations and therefore every single   fine is regular and cannot be attributed to one and the same violation. In the   smaller towns the zone is controlled directly by the traffic police. The ZTL is   indicated with vertical no-entry signs.

                    <h3>I was staying in a hotel right in the centre of the ZTL. Was I authorised?</h3>
                    In some Italian municipalities, the Guests of incoming structures may enter  the ZTL with their cars to reach the structure they are staying at. The hotel  must register the licence plates of the vehicle with the Municipal Police. If  this registration was not made and you have received a fine for accessing the  ZTL you must send us a document proving you stayed in the hotel (invoice or  declaration from the hotel).<br>
                    In other Italian municipalities, the Guests of hotels may enter the Limited Traffic Area (Z.T.L.) with their cars only and exclusively on the day of their arrival and/or departure for unloading/loading their luggage. At the moment of check-in and/or check-out, the hotel have to communicate the licence plate number of the vehicle to the Municipal Police. If the license plate number was wrongly entered into the Municipal Police website used for the registration of license plate numbers, you need to send us a copy of the hotel receipt and statement from the hotel confirming their mistake.

                    <ol>

                    <h3>Why didn’t I find a fine on the windscreen of my car?</h3>
                    The fine is always issued and attached under the front or rear windscreen wipers   of the vehicle in the event of a no-parking area or no-entry to the ZTL when not   monitored by an electronic device, even though this is not foreseen by the   traffic code, and therefore, not compulsory. It is not possible for the police   to know the reason why you did not find the fine; nevertheless this does not   mean that the fine sent to you by post is not regular or valid. Whenever the   police send the fine to your address of residence, according to the traffic code   you are also responsible for paying the postage, ascertainment and notification   expenses (art. 201 c. 4).
